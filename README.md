MOAL: Multi-Omic Analysis at Lab.

A simplified function to make reproducible omic bioanalysis.

Workflow summary:
 - Quality controls and unsupervised analysis: histogram, box plot, PCA and sample clustering.
 - Supervised analysis: analysis of variance (ANOVA) and filter application.
 - Unsupervised analysis for selected features: row clustering, PCA and pattern search across factor levels.
 - Graph generation for selected feature: volcanoplots, heatmaps, lineplots, boxplots, PCA
 - Functional analysis: MSigDB enrichment analysis and STRINGDB interaction network
