MOAL: Multi-Omic Analysis at Lab. A simplified workflow function to make reproducible omic bioanalysis.

R packages install:

install.packages("moal",repos=c("https://fdumbioinfo.r-universe.dev","https://cloud.r-project.org","https://bioc.r-universe.dev"))

Workflow summary:
 - Quality controls and unsupervised classification: histogram, box plot, PCA and sample clustering.
 - Supervised analysis: analysis of variance (ANOVA) and filter application.
 - Unsupervised analysis for selected features: row clustering, PCA and pattern search across factor levels.
 - Graph generation for selected feature: volcanoplots, heatmaps, lineplots, boxplots, PCA
 - Functional analysis: MSigDB enrichment analysis and STRINGDB interaction network
